        <p>Be prepared to have your preconceptions learned from Christianity and Judaism challenged bythis article. The word “kosher,” a term used to describe foods that comply with dietary guidelines set bytraditional Jewish law, does not occur in the scriptures. The Ghabaray word for “clean” is
        tahar (טהר) or tahor (טהור) and the word for “unclean” is
        tam'eh (טמא). The modern-day Jews, because they are descended from converts and are not the true people of the book according to paternal descent, do not know the identities of many of the animals mentioned in Thorah 3.11 (aka Leviticus 11) and Thorah 5.14 (aka Deuteronomy 14). Therefore, in their book
        Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 82:2) they rule for themselves that every animal is not kosher unless there is a well-established tradition among themselves that it is kosher. They don't know the ancient tongue and they have no prophet, so they grope in the dark with a book their ancestors did not write and they make up their own rules in books that they did write. This present article has none of these drawbacks.
        Are you ready? Lets go.
