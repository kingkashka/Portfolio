        <h2>WARNING.</h2>
        <p>Be prepared to have your preconceptions learned from Christianity and Judaism challenged bythis article. The word “kosher,” a term used to describe foods that comply with dietary guidelines set bytraditional Jewish law, does not occur in the scriptures. The Ghabaray word for “clean” is
        tahar (טהר) or tahor (טהור) and the word for “unclean” is
        tam'eh (טמא). The modern-day Jews, because they are descended from converts and are not the true people of the book according to paternal descent, do not know the identities of many of the animals mentioned in Thorah 3.11 (aka Leviticus 11) and Thorah 5.14 (aka Deuteronomy 14). Therefore, in their book
        Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 82:2) they rule for themselves that every animal is not kosher unless there is a well-established tradition among themselves that it is kosher. They don't know the ancient tongue and they have no prophet, so they grope in the dark with a book their ancestors did not write and they make up their own rules in books that they did write. This present article has none of these drawbacks.
        Are you ready? Lets go.
        “And YA'OH spoke to Mashah and to Ahran, saying to them: Speak to the sons of Yasharal saying thisis the living creature which you will eat from all the hoofed terrestrial animals which are upon the earth”
        (Thorah 3.11:1-2).
        BAHMAH ( בהמה ) = a hoofed terrestrial animal (ungulate), an animal that lives on the land instead of in
        the water and doesn't fly in the air.
        “Whatever is dividing hoof, and is the one cleaving cleft hoofs, the one causing to take up foliage, amongthe terrestrial animals, it will you all eat”
        (Thorah 3.11:3).
        MAPRASATH PARASAH ( מפרסת פרסה ) = the one dividing hoof. SHASAITH SHASAI PARSATH ( שסעת שסע פרסת ) = the one cleaving cleft hoofs. This animal may also have dewclaws, whereas some hoofed animals (such as giraff es and horses) do not have dewclaws. GARAH ( גרה ) = the leaves of a plant, collectively; leafage, foliage. The European Jewish and Christian translations have “cud,” but the active participle
        mylath ( מעלת ) “the one causing to take up” does not mean regurgitate. Mylath refers to herbivores and the act of grazing and foraging plant material andthe otherwise indigestible (by human gut) cellulose within grass and other forages and converting itinto meat, milk, wool and other animal products."</p>
