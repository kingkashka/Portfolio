            <h2>The Hoofed Animal - בהמה  </h2>
            <p>“And YHWH = יהוה spoke to Mashah and to Ahran, saying to them: Speak to the sons of Yasharal saying thisis the living creature which you will eat from all the hoofed terrestrial animals which are upon the earth” (Thorah 3.11:1-2). BAHMAH ( בהמה ) = a hoofed terrestrial animal (ungulate), an animal that lives on the land instead of in the water and doesn't fly in the air. “Whatever is dividing hoof, and is the one cleaving cleft hoofs, the one causing to take up foliage, amongthe terrestrial animals, it will you all eat” (Thorah 3.11:3). MAPRASATH PARASAH ( מפרסת פרסה ) = the one dividing hoof. SHASAITH SHASAI PARSATH ( שסעת שסע פרסת ) = the one cleaving cleft hoofs. This animal may also have dewclaws, whereas some hoofed animals (such as giraff es and horses) do not have dewclaws. GARAH ( גרה ) = the leaves of a plant, collectively; leafage, foliage. The European Jewish and Christian translations have “cud,” but the active participle mylath ( מעלת ) “the one causing to take up” does not mean regurgitate. Mylath refers to herbivores and the act of grazing and foraging plant material andthe otherwise indigestible (by human gut) cellulose within grass and other forages and converting itinto meat, milk, wool and other animal products."</p>
