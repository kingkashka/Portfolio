            <h2>The Hoofed Animal - בהמה  </h2>
            <p>“And YHWH = יהוה spoke to Mashah and to Ahran, saying to them: Speak to the sons of Yasharal saying this is the living creature which you will eat from all the hoofed animals which are upon the earth” (Torah-Leviticus 11:1-2). BAHEMAH ( בהמה ) = any hoofed quadraped animal that is classified in the clade as Euungulata ("True ungulates"). Ungulate is from the Late Latin adjective ungulatus, 'hoofed'. Ungulatus is a diminutive form of Latin unguis, 'nail'. “Whatever is dividing hoof, and is the one cleaving cleft hoofs, the one causing to take up foliage, among the land animals, it will you all eat” (Torah-Leviticus 11:3). MAPRASATH PARASAH ( מפרסת פרסה ) = the one dividing the hoof. SHASAITH SHASAI PARSATH ( שסעת שסע פרסת ) = the one cleaving the cleft hoofs. GARAH ( גרה ) = the leaves of a plant, collectively; leafage, foliage."</p>
